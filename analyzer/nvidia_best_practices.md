# NVIDIA Best Practices for Notebooks

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for creating high-quality Jupyter notebooks that align with NVIDIA's standards for developer content.

## Notebook Guidelines - Pre-Creation Checklist

### Impact and Uniqueness Assessment
- **Is this content impactful?**
  - Does it address a real developer need or use case?
  - Will it help developers accomplish a specific task?

- **Content Uniqueness Check**
  - Review existing NVIDIA notebooks to avoid duplication
  - Consider updating existing notebooks instead of creating new ones
  - Ensure the content provides unique value

- **Format Appropriateness**
  - Notebooks are ideal for single topics and interactive tutorials
  - For wide-ranging information, create a series of individual notebooks
  - Notebooks work best for small-scale data manipulation, not complex applications

- **Target Audience Definition**
  - Clearly define the target audience (experts vs beginners)
  - Identify the specific developer persona
  - Align content complexity with audience expertise

- **Learning Outcomes**
  - Ensure developers gain new skills or understanding
  - Define clear, measurable learning objectives
  - Focus on practical, actionable knowledge

## Structure and Layout Requirements

### Essential Components

#### 1. Informative Title
- **Format**: "Accomplish X with NVIDIA Product Name"
- **Requirements**:
  - Quickly indicate what the notebook does
  - Understandable by those unfamiliar with NVIDIA products
  - Follow Jobs-to-be-Done framework
- **Examples**:
  - ✅ "Modeling Intra-factory Transport with NVIDIA CuOpt"
  - ❌ "NVIDIA CuOpt Factory Modelling"
  - ❌ "Intra-factory Transport"

#### 2. Deploy Now Button
- Link to respective Launchable
- Optional Colab link if desired
- Must be prominently displayed

#### 3. Contributing Section
- Include section or contributing.md file
- Describe maintenance status
- Explain how users can submit issues and contributions
- Set clear expectations on response times
- Define acceptable contribution types

#### 4. Clear Introduction
**Must include all of the following:**
- Target persona identification
- Overview of notebook contents and learning outcomes
- Expected completion time
- Table of contents (especially for long notebooks)
- File structure with descriptions (optional for simple notebooks)
- Hardware, software, and knowledge requirements
- Data requirements if applicable
- NVIDIA tools and products used (with links to product pages)
- External tools used (with relevant links)

#### 5. Progressive Structure
- Use titles and headers to indicate progress
- Create clear navigation through content
- Break complex topics into logical sections

#### 6. Comprehensive Conclusion
- Summarize what the developer has learned
- Include call to action with links to:
  - Related NVIDIA content (notebooks, blogs, videos)
  - Related notebooks if part of a series
  - Relevant documentation
  - Next steps for continued learning
- **Never end abruptly with a code cell**

### Authorship Guidelines
- Add your name as author only if the work is truly your own
- Be prepared for direct developer contact for support
- Understand that developers may bypass official NVIDIA support channels

## Messaging and Content Standards

### Brand Consistency
- Follow NVIDIA messaging and style guidelines
- Maintain unified voice across all content
- Build trust through consistent presentation
- Consult appropriate PM for product-specific messaging

### Content Quality Requirements
- Use full sentences and standard grammar
- Clearly explain all notebook activities
- Guide and teach users through input and output
- Complete spell-checking before publication
- Write with SEO in mind:
  - Clearly describe problems being solved
  - Explain concepts being taught
  - Highlight critical job-to-be-done steps
  - Define desired outcomes

## Technical Implementation Standards

### Prerequisites and Requirements
- **Clear Prerequisites**: List after introduction
  - Minimum hardware requirements
  - Software requirements (including runtime environment)
  - Required knowledge level
  - Data requirements if applicable

- **Requirements.txt Management**:
  - All requirements must be in requirements.txt file
  - Install requirements within the notebook
  - Use fixed version numbers (e.g., matplotlib==3.10.0)
  - Include installation even if pre-installed in platform

- **Reproducibility Standards**:
  - Specify seeds wherever possible
  - Make notebooks as reproducible as possible
  - If not fully reproducible, avoid referencing specific outputs
  - Design for easy debugging

### Environment Variables
- **User-Set Variables**:
  - Specify in prerequisites section
  - Include code cell for setting environment variables
  - Never use config.py or .env files for user-required variables
  - Examples: NGC API Keys, authentication tokens

- **Static Configuration**:
  - Can use .env files for values users won't change
  - Document all configuration requirements

### File Structure Management
- **Minimize Additional Files**: Avoid where possible
- **When Additional Files Are Critical**:
  - Explain file structure using line diagrams
  - Briefly explain the purpose of each file
  - Link and double-check all file paths
  - Example structure format:
    ```
    MyFolder/
    ├── notebook.py
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── other_essential_file.py
    └── Data/
        └── data_file
    ```

### Maintenance Standards

#### Active Maintenance Requirements
- **Execution Standards**: Clean execution with fresh kernel, no errors
- **Environment Documentation**: Clear OS, GPU, environment variables, API keys, software requirements
- **Regular Review**: Check content every 2 months for relevance
- **GitHub Policy**: Clear maintenance, issues, and contribution policies

#### Maintenance Categories
- **Actively Maintained**: Meets all above requirements
- **Community Maintained**: Clear labeling with community support expectations
- **Archive**: Historical value but no active maintenance
